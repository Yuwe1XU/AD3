# AD3: A Multi-Scale Asynchronous Divide-Diffuse-Decode Diffusion Framework for TSP Solving [Scalable Data Science]
Code for the paper AD3: A Multi-Scale Asynchronous Divide-Diffuse-Decode Diffusion Framework for TSP Solving [Scalable Data Science]

## Dependencies
AD3 is built in Python 3.8.13  and Pytorch  1.11.0. 
And Please use the following command to install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## ckpt
The models for reproduce could be download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16taOEsz7L__BpKGVBh3oU3r5rvMYFdbC?usp=drive_link

## Evaluate
We provide both single-GPU and multi-GPU configurations in AD3_evaluate_S.py and AD3_evaluate_P.py. We are currently integrating them.

If you would like to use them, the reproducing setting file 'Reproducing_sets.txt' have been prepared details.
